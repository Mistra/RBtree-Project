NOTE: THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW IS UNUSABLE IN ANY CASE!

RBtree-Project is an universitary project set up for the mere purpose of improving knowledge in the programming field of algorithms and data structures. In this case, the subject is the implementation of a particularly simple and (I hope) understandable version of the RedBlack trees.
Any use, change or dependency of/from source code is free but the owner WILL NOT in any case be responsable of evental errors deriving from the use or wrong use of the code and WILL NOT be and feel obliged to provide any kind of support.
